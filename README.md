# SAE BAJA INDIA 2024
This repository is for managing the versions of the design of an ATV for the SAE BAJA INDIA 2024 competition. The competition is a student design competition that simulates real-world engineering design projects. Teams of students from colleges and universities across India design, build, and test an off-road vehicle. The competition is divided into two phases: a preliminary round and a final round.

The preliminary round is a virtual event that tests the technical and professional capacity of teams. Teams submit a presentation of their design and implementation plans. The top teams from the preliminary round advance to the final round, which is a physical event that tests the performance of the vehicles.

The SAE BAJA INDIA 2024 competition is a great opportunity for students to gain real-world engineering experience. Teams learn how to design, build, and test vehicles. They also learn how to work as a team and manage a project. The competition is also a great way to network with other students and professionals in the engineering field.
